## 1. How does `React` work?
React JS creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a `diffing algorithm`, which identifies what has changed in the virtual DOM. The second step is reconciliation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff.

## 2. What is `JSX`?
JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript and comes with the full power of JavaScript. JSX produces React "elements". You can embed any JavaScript expression in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces. After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript objects. This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions.

## Q: What is `Config Driven UI`?
`Config Driven UI` are based on the configurations of the data application receives. It is rather a good practice to use config driven UIs to make application for dynamic. 
It is a very common & basic approach to interact with the User. It provides a generic interface to develop things which help your project scale well. It saves a lot of development time and effort.
A typical login form, common in most of the Apps. Most of these forms also get frequent updates as the requirements increase in terms of Form Validations, dropdown options,.. or design changes.


## Q: How can I write `comments` in JSX?
A: JSX comments are written as follows:
- `{/*  */}` - for single or multiline comments
#### Example
```
{/* A JSX comment */}
{/* 
  Multi
  line
  JSX
  comment
*/}
```

## Q: What is `Reconciliation` in React?
`Reconciliation` is the process through which React updates the Browser DOM and makes React work faster. React use a `diffing algorithm` so that component updates are predictable and faster. React would first calculate the difference between the real DOM and the copy of DOM (Virtual DOM) when there's an update of components.
React stores a copy of Browser DOM which is called `Virtual DOM`. When we make changes or add data, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one. Comparison is done by `Diffing Algorithm`.
React compares the Virtual DOM with Real DOM. It finds out the changed nodes and updates only the changed nodes in Real DOM leaving the rest nodes as it is. This process is called Reconciliation.



## Q: Is `JSX` mandatory for React?
`JSX` is an Extension Syntax that allows writing HTML and Javascript together easily in React and is used to create React elements. These elements are then rendered to the React DOM. Each JSX element is just to make use of React easy and for calling React.createElement(component, props, …children) with less work. So, anything that is done with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript. So `JSX` is not mandatory but is used for writing better and clean code instead of writing code using `React.CreateElement`.
#### Example of `JSX`
```
const sample = <h2>Hello</h2>;
```

## Q: Is `ES6` mandatory for React?
A: `ES6` is not mandatory for `React` but is highly recommendable. The latest projects created on React rely a lot on ES6. React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like: Classes, Arrow Functions, Variables(let, const).
ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6. ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015.


## Q: What is the importance of `config.js` file?
A: `config.js` files are essentially editable text files that contain information required for the successful operation of a program. The files are structured in a particular way, formatted to be user configurable.
Most of the computer programs we use: whether office suites, web browsers, even video games are configured via menu interfaces.
Configuration files are very simple in structure. For instance, if you were to write an application, and the only thing it ever needed to know was its user's preferred name, then its one and only config file could contain exactly one word: the name of the user.

## Q:  Why `virtual DOM` is faster to update than real DOM? ?
The virtual DOM is faster to update than the real DOM because React uses a clever technique to minimize the number of updates that need to be made to the real DOM.

- When you update the virtual DOM, React will compare the new virtual DOM with the old one, determine which parts have changed, and then update the real DOM accordingly. This means that only the parts of the DOM that actually need to be changed are updated, which is much faster than updating the entire DOM every time there is a change.

- Furthermore, the virtual DOM is implemented in JavaScript, which is generally faster to execute than the native code that is used to manipulate the real DOM.

- This means that React can perform updates to the virtual DOM quickly, and then use the resulting diff to make efficient updates to the real DOM.

## Q: What would happen if we do `console.log(useState())`?
If we do `console.log(useState())`, we get an array `[undefined, function]`  where first item in an array is `state` is `undefined` and the second item in an array is `setState` `function` is bound dispatchSetState.



## Q: What is the difference between state and props?
`State` is a data structure that starts with a default value when a Component mounts. It may be mutated across time, mostly as a result of user events.

## Q: What are `refs` used for in React?
`Refs` are used to get reference to a DOM node or an instance of a component in React. Good examples of when to use refs are for managing focus/text selection, triggering imperative animations, or integrating with third-party DOM libraries. You should avoid using string refs and inline ref callbacks. Callback refs are advised by React.

## Q: What is the difference between `Client Side Routing` and `Server Side Routing`?
In `Server-side routing or rendering (SSR)`, every change in URL, http request is made to server to fetch the webpage, and replace the current webpage with the older one. 

In `Client-side routing or rendering (CSR)`, during the first load, the webapp is loaded from server to client, after which whenever there is a change in URL, the router library navigates the user to the new page without sending any request to backend. All `Single Page Applications uses client-side routing`.
